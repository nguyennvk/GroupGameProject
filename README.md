# GroupGameProject
This is a group (Bangcheng Wang, Aaron Li, Aiden Cullen, Vo Khoi Nguyen Nguyen) project about creating an adventure
game. The game can be played by command given in the text box or it can be play by using mouse. We add accessibility
part as part of our game so that non-sight person can also play it by hearing. There is also a menu to change the 
setting such as sound and brightness.
We use 2 external libraries that you need to add in order to run the game. The first library is javafx which you can
download at this link https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/ and another one is free text to speech downloaded at
https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetts/files/.
