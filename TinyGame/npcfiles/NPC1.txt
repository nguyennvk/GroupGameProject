Mysterious Voice

Oh good, you're finally awake
Welcome to my home, I'm sure you'll find it cozy.
If you're wondering why you're here, allow me to refresh your memory.
You were in a bar with your pals, probably pretty drunk.
You made the stupid decision to walk up to me and challenge me to a duel!
Since I'm a wizard, I accepted, then teleported you here and erased your memories.
If you want to escape, be my guest! Although you're probably too stupid to do so.
Have a good night!
